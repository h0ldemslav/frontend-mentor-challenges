## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Mistakes and continued development

Through this whole project I struggled most with desktop layout, because I couldn't decide what to use, fluid grids or CSS grid and faced some problems with sizing elements. So, I suppose, I must create more static pages with CSS Grid or Flexbox to improve my skills.   

Also, I wasted some time with mobile design, because of bad markup in some places. Now I always will start by writing a _solid_ HTML structure first and only then style the page.


### Useful resources

Because I'm a novice, I only used validators for HTML and CSS and MDN documentation. (I consider that everyone uses it)

- [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
- [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en#validate_by_input)
- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
