## My process

### Built with

-   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - CSS framework
-   CSS custom properties
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I mainly wanted to practice my CSS skills using a CSS framework - Bootstrap. So the biggest outcome is that now I'm way more familiar with the framework and feel ready to use in my future projects, if there is a need.

### Continued development

Use more CSS frameworks, they're very convenient and suggest using some interesting approaches. Though it's still good to remember and practice the basics of CSS (helped me throughout this challenge when I was writing additional styles).
