### What I learned

First time I've tried React for Frontend Mentor challenge. Most intricate parts was state handling and creating/nesting components, because I had some doubts, if I should create a new component or not.

### Continued development

As always I would like to focus more on CSS and JavaScript to create fancy and useful web interfaces in the future. Also, I would like to continue to learn React and use it more often to get a better grasp.
