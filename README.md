# Front-end challenges

The purpose of this repository is to master front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and their libraries/frameworks. All tasks and resources are taken from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). They belong to their authors, I don't own any of them.

Visit [my account page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/h0ldemslav) to see some of my solutions.
